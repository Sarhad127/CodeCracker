All codes you input in the password.txt file will be hashed by MD5 and SHA-256 and stored in a different file called hashes.txt in this format(password,MD5hash, SHA256hash)
You can generate hashes on the first page
and check if a password exists by it's hash code on the second page.

note that the generated hashes do not get saved and stored.
